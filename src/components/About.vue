          human experience. The band was founded in 2019, with members coming
          from different corners of the Icelandic metal scene, blending their
          influences into Drápa’s distinct sound. Since then, Drápa has been
          making a name for itself with powerful live performances and an
          authentic sound.

        <p>
          Drápa released its debut album in the spring of 2024. The album
          captures the band’s unfiltered energy, combining heavy compositions
          with strong lyrics that explore existential struggles, fear and
          resilience. The band members place great emphasis on a commanding
          stage presence that creates a unique atmosphere at their shows.

          Drápa aims to take Icelandic metal to new heights and gain recognition
          both domestically and internationally.
